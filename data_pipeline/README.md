# Airflow Sentiment Analysis Data Pipeline

This project sets up an Apache Airflow data pipeline using Docker Compose to manage sentiment analysis tasks. The pipeline automates data processing, storage, and analysis tasks, storing results in organized CSV files and ensuring reproducibility with DVC.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- **`dags/`**: Contains the main Airflow DAG file, `data_pipeline.py`, which defines the pipeline tasks.
- **`data/`**: Holds raw, processed, and final datasets in CSV format. These files are version-controlled with DVC.
- **`tests/`**: Contains unit tests to ensure the functionality and accuracy of each component in the pipeline.
- **`.dvc/`**: Metadata directory managed by DVC to track data file versions and dependencies.
- **`docker-compose.yml`**: Defines the containerized services for Airflow, including the Airflow scheduler, web server, and workers.

## 🔄 Data Pipeline Overview

The pipeline performs the following steps:

1. **Download and Load Data**: Load review and metadata datasets from Hugging Face into the `data/` directory.

2. **Schema Validation**: Validates the data schema to ensure it conforms to expected formats and structures, catching any structural issues in the data before processing.

3. **Preprocess and Clean Data**: Removes HTML tags, filters out URLs or file paths, and formats the text for analysis.

4. **Feature Engineering**: Analyzes the sentiment of reviews using multiple models (e.g., heuristic, VADER, TextBlob) and applies majority voting to determine the final sentiment label.

5. **Store Results**: Saves the final processed data to `final_amazon_reviews.csv` in the `data/` folder.

6. **Error Handling and Logging**: Implements comprehensive logging and error handling at each step to track pipeline progress, catch issues, and store error messages for debugging.

7. **Email Notifications**: Sends email notifications to the team in case of pipeline failures, ensuring prompt attention and reducing downtime.

## ⚙️ Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Ensure **Docker** and **Docker Compose** are installed on your system.

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/madhurima-vanga/Amazon-Customer-Sentiment-Analyser.git
   cd Amazon-Customer-Sentiment-Analyser/data_pipeline
   ```

2. **Modify SMTP Settings in `docker-compose.yml` to get Alerts**:
   - Locate the `docker-compose.yml` file.
   - Update the line for the SMTP password with the password provided in the Canvas submission/comment:
     ```yaml
     AIRFLOW__SMTP__SMTP_PASSWORD: <password provided for email service in canvas submission>
     ```

3. **Set the Success and Failure Email in `params.py`**:
   - In the `dags/` folder, open the `params.py` file.
   - Update the `email_params` dictionary with your preferred email for receiving notifications:
     ```python
     email_params = {
         'success_email': 'your_success_email@example.com',
         'failure_email': 'your_failure_email@example.com',
     }
     ```

4. **Initialize Airflow**:
   Before running Airflow, initialize the database and create necessary directories:
   ```bash
   docker compose up airflow-init
   ```
   For WINDOWS uers: Create a file called .env in the same folder as docker-compose.yaml and set the user as follows before running airflow:
   ```bash
   AIRFLOW_UID=50000
   ```

5. **Start Airflow Services**:
   Run the following command to start the Airflow scheduler, web server, and other services:
   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

   Access the Airflow web interface at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) with the default credentials:

   - **Username**: `airflow`
   - **Password**: `airflow`

6. **Enable and Trigger the Sentiment Analysis DAG**:
   - In the Airflow web interface, locate the DAG named **`sentiment_analysis_pipeline`**.
   - **Enable** the DAG by toggling it to "On."
   - **Trigger** the DAG manually to start the pipeline and monitor its progress.

## 🧪 Running Tests

Unit tests for the pipeline are written with pytest and located in the `tests/` folder.

- **Create a Virtual Environment:** You can use the following command to create a virtual environment named venv:
```bash
  python -m venv venv
  ```

- **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

- **Install Required Packages:**
```bash
cd data_pipeline
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- **Run the Tests**
Now that your environment is set up with the required dependencies, you can run your tests using pytest:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)/dags:$(pwd) python -m pytest tests/
```


  This will execute all unit tests and display results, verifying the functionality of each pipeline component.

## 🗄️ Data Storage

Processed data from the Airflow tasks, such as CSV files generated by the pipeline, are stored in the `data/` directory within the project. This folder will contain:

- **reviews.csv**: The raw reviews dataset.
- **metadata.csv**: The raw metadata dataset.
- **merged_data.csv**: Merged review and metadata file.
- **preprocessed_reviews.csv**: Cleaned and processed review data for analysis.
- **final_amazon_reviews.csv**: Final output containing sentiment analysis results.

## 📊 Data Versioning with DVC

DVC ensures reproducibility by tracking versions of datasets and outputs.

- **Configure Remote Storage**: Use DVC to store data files remotely (e.g., Amazon S3). For example:
  ```bash
  dvc remote add -d myremote s3://amazonsentimentanalysis/mlops-dvc
  ```

- **Add New Data Versions**: For each new data version, use `dvc add` and push it to the remote storage.
  
- **Pull Data Versions**: Team members can download specific data versions as needed:
  ```bash
  dvc pull
  ```

- **View Data Version History**: DVC allows viewing the full history of data file versions for reproducibility.

```dvc status```

```cat .dvc/config```

## 🧹 Cleaning Up

To stop the containers, press **CTRL+C** in the terminal where Docker Compose is running.

To remove all containers and reset Airflow, run:
```bash
docker compose down --volumes --remove-orphans
```

This command will stop all services and remove volumes, clearing the Airflow database and any temporary files.

---

With this setup, the project is ready for data processing, sentiment analysis, and version-controlled data storage using DVC.
