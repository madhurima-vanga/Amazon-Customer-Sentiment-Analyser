Bias Mitigation and Model Evaluation Workflow
This repository contains a comprehensive pipeline for data splitting, bias detection, mitigation, model training, and deployment using Google Cloud services and state-of-the-art machine learning frameworks. The key components are organized as follows:

Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or above
Google Cloud SDK installed and authenticated
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable set to a valid GCP service account key
Required Python libraries (install via requirements.txt):
torch, transformers, mlflow, google-cloud-storage, pandas, sklearn, datasets
Workflow Overview
1. Data Splitting (data_split.py)
This script:

Loads a dataset from Google Cloud Storage (GCS).
Maps sentiment labels (positive, negative, neutral) to numeric labels (0, 1, 2).
Splits the data into balanced train, test, and inference sets.
Uploads the split datasets back to GCS.
Key Outputs:
Train set: gs://<bucket_name>/model/train/train.csv
Test set: gs://<bucket_name>/model/test/test.csv
Inference set: gs://<bucket_name>/model/validate/inference.csv
2. Bias Detection (bias.py)
This script:

Evaluates model performance across slices of sensitive features (e.g., categories).
Uses metrics such as fairness disparity to detect potential bias.
Key Metrics:
Accuracy per slice
Fairness-related metrics (e.g., parity, disparate impact)
3. Bias Mitigation (bias_mitigation.py)
This script:

Balances classes within each sensitive feature (e.g., product category).
Resamples data to ensure equal representation of all classes.
Calculates sample weights for reweighting.
Uploads the revised dataset to GCS.
Key Outputs:
Revised dataset: gs://<bucket_name>/bias_mitigation/train_bias_mitigation.csv
4. Model Training (model.py)
This script:

Loads and tokenizes data using Hugging Face transformers.
Fine-tunes a RoBERTa model on the training dataset.
Evaluates the model on the test dataset.
Logs metrics and artifacts to MLflow.
Key Features:
Integrated with MLflow for experiment tracking.
Supports GPU acceleration for training.
Key Outputs:
Fine-tuned model and tokenizer in local storage (./fine_tuned_roberta)
MLflow logs and artifacts.
5. Model Registration and Deployment (register.py)
This script:

Converts the trained model to a format compatible with Vertex AI.
Uploads the model to GCS.
Registers the model in Vertex AI for serving.
Key Outputs:
Serialized model: gs://<bucket_name>/saved_models/model.pkl
Registered model in Vertex AI.
How to Run
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up Google Cloud credentials:

bash
Copy code
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="path/to/your-service-account-key.json"
Execute the scripts in the following order:

Step 1: Data Splitting

bash
Copy code
python data_split.py
Step 2: Bias Detection

bash
Copy code
python bias.py
Step 3: Bias Mitigation

bash
Copy code
python bias_mitigation.py
Step 4: Model Training

bash
Copy code
python model.py
Step 5: Model Registration and Deployment

bash
Copy code
python register.py
Logging
All scripts log information to the logs/ directory.
Logs include timestamps, script-specific details, and error handling information.
Notes
Ensure all bucket names, file paths, and project IDs are updated according to your GCP configuration.
Modify training parameters in model.py as needed for your dataset and computational resources.
